Check storing and retrieving transient messages

    Let's begin by instantiating our utility, always a good start
    >>> from opencore.member.transient_messages import TransientMessage
    >>> app = self.app
    >>> tm = TransientMessage(app)
    >>> tm
    <TransientMessage at >

    Now, we can start to store all kinds of messages
    >>> tm.store('m1', 'ghosts', 'there is only zul')
    >>> tm.store('m1', 'ghosts', 'all hail vigor')
    >>> tm.store('m1', 'foo', 'bar')
    >>> tm.store('m2', 'ghosts', 'stay puff marshmallow man')
    >>> tm.store('m1', 'ghosts', 'do not cross the streams')

    And what good would messages be if we couldn't retrieve them
    >>> msgs = tm.get_msgs('m1', 'ghosts')
    >>> msgs
    <IOBTreeItems object at ...>

    But they are generated for efficiency, so we have to list them
    >>> list(msgs)
    [(0, 'there is only zul'), (1, 'all hail vigor'), (2, 'do not cross the streams')]

    Let's check to make sure the rest of our msgs are playing nice
    >>> list(tm.get_msgs('m1', 'foo'))
    [(0, 'bar')]
    >>> list(tm.get_msgs('m2', 'ghosts'))
    [(0, 'stay puff marshmallow man')]

Can we get all messages across all categories? Yes, but this is not
efficient, since it dereferences all the messages upon generation::
    >>> len(tm.get_all_msgs('m1'))
    4

    And if we try to get messages for non existent members/categories,
    we just get nothing back
    >>> msgs = tm.get_msgs('m3', 'whatever-man')
    >>> msgs
    <IOBTreeItems object at ...>
    >>> list(msgs)
    []
    >>> list(tm.get_msgs('m2', 'spud'))
    []

    And we can also pop these guys off according to their index
    >>> tm.pop('m1', 'ghosts', 1)
    'all hail vigor'
    >>> tm.pop('m2', 'ghosts', 0)
    'stay puff marshmallow man'

    And poof, they are gone from the list
    >>> list(tm.get_msgs('m1', 'ghosts'))
    [(0, 'there is only zul'), (2, 'do not cross the streams')]
    >>> list(tm.get_msgs('m2', 'ghosts'))
    []

    If we try to pop an invalid index, we get a KeyError
    >>> tm.pop('m1', 'ghosts', 17)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    KeyError: 17

    And if we add a new msg, it should get the highest id
    >>> tm.store('m1', 'ghosts', 'gatekeeper and keymaster')
    >>> list(tm.get_msgs('m1', 'ghosts'))
    [(0, 'there is only zul'), (2, 'do not cross the streams'), (3, 'gatekeeper and keymaster')]

    Now we just have to check that when we try to get the utility,
    we actually get the right object back.  We pass in the portal
    as the explicit context for the utility lookup, since setSite doesn't
    seem to work for us here in test-land.
    >>> from opencore.interfaces.message import ITransientMessage
    >>> getUtility(ITransientMessage, context=self.portal)
    <TransientMessage at /plone/utilities/>
