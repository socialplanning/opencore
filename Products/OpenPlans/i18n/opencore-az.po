We are a dot-org: a non-profit building technology to enhance civic participation. We care about what we build, and we're open source through and through.</p> <p>We created OpenPlans for social change groups, to help them save time and become more effective. These groups often have a lot of passion and smarts, but not a lot of extra people power or time.</p> <p>OpenPlans is our third initiative. We also founded <a href=\"http://geoserver.org/\">GeoServer</a>, a platform for sharing geographic information, and we are collaborators in the <a href=\"http://nycsr.org/\">New York City Streets Renaissance</a>, a campaign for lively public space in NYC.</p> <p>TOPP was born in 2000.</p>"
